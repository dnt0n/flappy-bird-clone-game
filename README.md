# flappy-bird-clone-game
A Flappy Bird Clone Game. A modified code-along project from YouTuber Clear Code's Flappy Bird Clone video. I added more game elements to make it more fun.

In the code file there are 3 files: main, settings, and sprites.

To run the game, run the main file.

On top of YouTuber Clear Code's implementation, I added the below functionalities:
1. Added the ability to adjust more game settings such as obstacle size, gravity, jump height, obstacle speed and intervals under the settings file.
2. Added 2 more types of obstacles - double pillars and stones to increase the difficulty and playability of the game.
3. Added a feature which increases game difficulty as score increases. There are three difficulty tiers - easy, medium and hard which correspond to different game speeds.
4. Added plane crash sound.
